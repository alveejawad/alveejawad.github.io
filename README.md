Here are some steps on how to host a website online-  
*Open an account on GitHub.

Some FAQs-  
1. A question about the overall process, such as "Why is Markdown better than a word
processor?"  
-Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is simple to use because of the easy syntax. Markdown is a  plain text file and can be opened and edited by any text editor using any operating system which means it does not need a special software to use. Changes made to the documents are easy to track and you do not have to worry about the different versions and there is no format for it. Hence markdown is easy to maintain and shareable than a word document. Here is a link to a [book](https://read.amazon.ca/?ref_=dbs_p_ebk_r00_pbcb_rnvc00&_encoding=UTF8&asin=B01A2QL9SS) to get a better understanding on markdown and why it is important to use markdown in technical writing.
2. A question about the practical details, such as "Why is my resume not showing up?"  
-The name for the repository would be username.github.io. Make sure that the username is the same as the username you used for the account.
