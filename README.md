Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is simple to use because of the easy syntax. Markdown is a  plain text file and can be opened and edited by any text editor using any operating system which means it does not need a special software to use. Changes made to the documents are easy to track and you do not have to worry about the different versions and there is no format for it. Hence markdown is easy to maintain and shareable than a word document. Here is a link to a [book](https://read.amazon.ca/?ref_=dbs_p_ebk_r00_pbcb_rnvc00&_encoding=UTF8&asin=B01A2QL9SS) to get a better understanding on markdown and why it is important to use markdown in technical writing.  
Here are some steps on how to host a website online-  
*Open an account on GitHub.  
*Create a repository with the username you used for your account. The name for the repository would be username.github.io. Make sure that the username is the same as the username you used for the account.  
*The next step is to download the GitHub desktop app from their website. The respository you have created needs to be cloned so click on "Set up in Desktop" button and then save your project. Add a readme on setting up the repository. You can import you resume that is written in markdown language by clicking on the add file.  
*Go to settings and then click on pages and click on the save button.
